\chapter{Parallel simulation}
\label{cha:parallel_sim}

Running a \emph{OMNeT++} simulation using multiple processors different requirements must be met.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:parallel_sim_requriements}

For a parallel simulation a message passing interface (\emph{MPI}) library must be provided.
For linux machines the open source library openMPI can be easily used.

As described in \cite{varga_parallel_2003} OMNeT++ is capable of running a parallel simulation when specific requirements are met.
In \cite{varga_parallel_2003} the requirements include the compliance to OMNeT++ design guides, for example the strict usage of messages and channels for transmitting events and data.
Is this requirement not met and communication between modules was achieved by a direct method call the simulation cannot be executed parallel.
Running the simulation parallelized can achieve better timings and improve the performance of real time simulations
This improvement could be possible due to shortened execution times and also the extended possibility for emulation and the field of \emph{HiL}.
For this usage a module can be assigned to a logical processor and handle all messages which interfere with connected real systems.
